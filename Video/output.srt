00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:45,480
you find the metal behind your van and then you go to the back of the van

124
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,840

129
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,400
I didn't see it on instagram I swear I thought of this

130
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,400
I don't believe you women be lying so much they probably just asked Rosa Parks to

just move over I saw you saw the instagram I know you

132
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,240
but I thought about this the day no how's her husband also has a car

133
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,600
I also thought about this the other day did you know Japan's

134
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:34,599
something that you come here Judas

135
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,559
what did you let me

136
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:45,800
you know what's hilarious no I don't know I saw that shit on like an article like

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,357
three or four years ago that Japan was starting to implement that like

138
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,839
thing into their crosswalks whatever and all the sudden everyone in

139
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,120
instagram's just like hey guys you know this I'm like oh I thought everyone knew

140
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,920
this already knew what that Japan was putting like pressure

141
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,719
plates underneath some of their sidewalks to generate energy because so

142
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:11,000
many people walk down in Shibuya oh because that was like a pretty big

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,160
talking point four years ago when they were first implementing it like I

144
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,079
my dad knew about that and my dad doesn't like no shit about anywhere

145
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:24,120
outside of America and he knew that it was a pretty big talking point for a

146
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,160
while I could go into fire and I'm going to fire

147
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,360
all of a sudden why would you walk over hey do this

148
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
device

149
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,319
oh I'm supposed to leave the van and start walking down the path why don't you

150
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:40,199
ah that's why I need to scratch the wrench I don't know how to have anything

151
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:44,360
through walking down the path because you craft the wrench so you can open

152
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,520
the vent the open the dirt I'm not paying attention I'm just

153
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,199
playing the game yeah I wasn't paying attention either

154
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:57,800
I thought you craft the wrench you can open the fence and drive your car out

155
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,959
oh you're supposed to have the car out I was walking

156
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,000
and go back and go back and walk

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,400
you can do multiplayer okay

158
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,207

159
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,079

No, that's for building the hammer's just for building. Oh, he likes me. Do I get nothing out of that.

341
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,310
I beat it to death with this log just. Oh, it's an appliance. Oh, trash. Oh, yeah, I get to pick up litter. Oh, oh, I, it's following me now. I think we can kill it. Look, there's a plane. I'm

342
00:25:50,600 --> 00:26:04,600
picking the plane. I'm picking the plane. You're paying the plane. Oh, I said, best feature in the game so far. Can I make this rabbit walk into fire? Where's it go? Money. Where'd it go?

343
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:14,600
The place of the room. I think it's right here. No, it's over here. Oh, there's not following me no more. And that's over here.

344
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Just gets a friend of mine. It's right here. There's nothing there. It's right here. There's nothing there on my screen big fella. I don't know what you are from me.

345
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:38,600
It's a friend of mine. It's okay. We're going to get you the best doctors. That's what they said. They're like to me. Do you think if we get the campfire leave it going, it'll burn down the woods.

346
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Yeah, we could try. I mean, have we been putting out any other ones? Nope. Yeah, then it'll be fine. It's a good thing we're heading towards a firewatch. So.

347
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,010
Oh, I wasn't looking at the map. Open your map. And.

348
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,860
No, where's that? Oh, I was supposed to do that. Look at the objective list. Give me a go. You are the game developers worst nightmare.

349
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:29,600
What is that bro, they have a list telling you what to do. And you're like, what am I supposed to do? There's a track down list of what you're supposed to do.

350
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:49,600
You're going to get a lot of time. You buy a bullet and you're able to recharge it. Okay. Can I use rounded. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come down. Yes. Yes. I can't go in. Yes. It doesn't work. I forget what I just said.

351
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Now, how, how to fuck do we, how do we, how do we charge this shit? How do we motor info? Well, according to my calculations.

352
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,600
It's got to be in the front. Hey, dumb ass. There's nothing different.

353
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Oh, that's the fiber tour. Okay. There we go. Not the motor and batteries in the bio and bio burner. Yeah. Yeah. Stop them fiber. Do you need fiber?

354
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Put some trash in here to get some more tickets. Actually, you want to go to sleep in the night time where you want to start driving since it's nighttime. We drive since it's nighttime. Do you want to drive? No, I'm the woman. I can drive.

355
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Yeah. Yeah. Now let me hold your legs. You can hold my third leg. Hold on. There's berries. We're going to need food because you're dumbass killed yourself in the fire.

356
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Now I got full health. Nothing once I rest again. My help back. Okay.

357
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Okay, fire. We can, we had a bridge. Oh, broken bridge. Good thing that popped up. I was about to drive right over that bitch.

358
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,600
I guess it's a hill. I probably shouldn't.

359
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,600
It's a hill. Yes. Yes. Hill. I'm very intelligent. Yes.

360
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Oh, that's the fire thing you're going to really hope the demo doesn't end when we get to the fire thing.

361
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,600
I really hope that that's the time is it. You're not having fun. No, I am. But I got to go to sleep.

362
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Yeah, it was just we didn't have to play this tonight. I'm sleeping. Now this is this is a lady.

363
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Lady. You want to come out the truck? Yeah, we were going to go to sleep because this night.

364
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,600
It's about to walk up to the campfire. But.

365
00:29:49,600 --> 00:30:02,600
I think you're like this time. I'll open the door.

366
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,600
I thought that's on the bed. That's how I was turning around slowly.

367
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Fresh. Shut up. What man? Okay. Fire goes up next day. I guess.

368
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:23,600
I guess. Unless you didn't like that. I didn't like that one. I didn't like it either.

369
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
You better calm down there, pal.

370
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Why do you rehearse in this time? I can't think of any other white people phrases.

371
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,600
It's like get a load of this guy. Dude.

372
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,600
You say, dude, everyone says, dude, what the fuck?

373
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,600
I don't like it. Like get a load of this guy. You're getting on my nerves, pal.

374
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Hey buddy. Hey buddy. Knock it off.

375
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,600
And that's bullshit.

376
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,600
What are you doing?

377
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,600
I'm going to do it. It's your face.

378
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I was going to say sister, but since there's actually nice.

379
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,600
You're face.

380
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,600
I'm stuck.

381
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,600
I went up for you.

382
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,600
I found the Usp stick.

383
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I found the password data bank.

384
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,600
I found the banana.

385
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
I'm trying.

386
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,600
What kind of sitting down on my door?

387
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,710
You hear that beeping sound? Yeah.

388
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,600
You just heard that?

389
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,600
No, you know what that sounds like?

390
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,600
I thought it was in my head.

391
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,600
I'm just sorry.

392
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,210
Bro, does that beeping sound like the raw science?

393
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:11,570
Hey, when it's going to be on sale, man?

394
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:16,570
I don't know.

395
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,570
I did.

396
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:26,570
I'm not wasting my rock.

397
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:31,570
It's rock.

398
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:36,570
I'm grabbing all the rock codes.

399
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,570
I'm grabbing all the rock codes.

400
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,570
I collected all 500 pine cones.

401
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,570
I'm not going to do that.

402
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,570
I'm not going to do that.

403
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:00,570
I'm not going to do that.

404
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:05,570
I'm not going to do that.

405
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,570
I'm not going to do that.

406
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,570
I'm not going to do that.

407
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:20,570
I'm not going to do that.

408
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,570
I'm not going to do that.

409
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,570
I'm not going to do that.

410
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:35,570
I'm not going to do that.

411
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,570
I'm not going to do that.

412
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:44,570
I'm not going to do that.

413
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:49,570
I'm not going to do that.

414
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,570
I'm not going to do that.

415
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:59,570
I'm not going to do that.

416
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:04,570
I'm not going to do that.

417
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,570
I'm not going to do that.

418
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,570
I'm not going to do that.

419
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:18,570
I'm not going to do that.

420
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:23,570
I'm not going to do that.

421
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:28,570
I'm not going to do that.

422
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:33,570
I'm not going to do that.

423
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,570
I'm not going to do that.

424
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:42,570
I'm not going to do that.

425
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,570
I'm not going to do that.

426
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:52,570
What did you just do?

427
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,570
What did you just do?

428
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,570
Come here.

429
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,570
Watch me go down the stairs.

430
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:10,570
I'm not going to do that.

431
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:15,570
I'm not going to do that.

432
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:20,570
It's amazing.

433
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,570
It's amazing.

434
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,570
It's amazing.

435
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,570
I'm not going to do that.

436
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:40,570
I'm not going to do that.

437
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:45,570
I'm not going to do that.

438
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:50,570
I'm not going to do that.

439
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:55,570
I'm not going to do that.

440
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,570
I'm not going to do that.

441
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:04,570
I'm not going to do that.

442
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:09,570
I'm not going to do that.

443
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,570
I'm not going to do that.

444
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:19,570
I'm not going to do that.

445
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:24,570
I'm not going to do that.

446
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,570
I'm not going to do that.

447
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:33,570
I'm not going to do that.

448
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,570
I want you to research the axe.

449
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:43,570
I want you to play the minigame.

450
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,570
They're not bad before you get used to them.

451
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,570
They're super fucking easy.

452
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:58,570
I'm not going to do that.

453
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:03,570
I'm not going to do that.

454
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:08,570
You struggle on the push-up minigame in GPO for hockey.

455
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:13,570
It's not a push-up.

456
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:18,570
It's push-ups and slayers, but it's the same car.

457
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,570
That's why I was never a slayer, dude.

458
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,570
I'm not going to do that.

459
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:32,570
I'm not going to do that.

460
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:37,570
I'm not going to do that.

461
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:41,180
I'm not going to do that.

462
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,660
I'm not going to do that.

463
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:52,570
I'm not going to do that.

464
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,780
I'm not going to do that.

465
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,230
I'm not going to do that.

466
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:07,570
I don't believe you.

467
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:12,570
You didn't get gardening.

468
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,570
I'm not going to do that.

469
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,570
Maybe resources to make two axes.

470
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:27,570
Maybe resources don't share.

471
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:32,570
We can save here if you want.

472
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,880
You can play the gnome game.

473
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:37,680
I'm not going to do that.

474
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:47,570
I'm not going to do that.

475
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:52,570
I'm not going to do that.

476
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,410
I'm not going to do that.

477
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:02,570
I'm not going to do that.

478
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:07,570
I'm not going to do that.

479
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,790
I'm not going to do that.

480
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,830
Play tutorial or just note tutorial.

481
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,090
Holy shit.

482
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:30,570
This is demo version of

483
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:35,570
the game.

484
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:40,570
I don't know.

485
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,010
The campaign game, we got the whole first world.

486
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,760
We got one fourth of the game as the demo.

487
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:55,570
That's crazy.

488
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:00,570
I'm not going to do that.

489
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:05,570
I need more helium storage.

490
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,570
I can't get it without having more helium.

491
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,570
Nothing dies.

492
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:19,570
I'm hovering helium.

493
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,570
I need two thousand eight hundred more helium storage.

494
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:29,570
I'm able to reset.

495
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:34,570
What this fucking game will not let me.

496
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:39,570
Bro, this game weather.

497
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,570
Just let it happen.

498
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,570
No, I don't want the campaign to start it.

499
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,570
If it is started, we'll just play the gaming game.

500
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:59,570
Whenever we have a chance.

501
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:04,570
4.50 to bomb a blood clot.

Once you walk all around here and there's no way to get back on the other side.
